# Regular Expressions (RegEx)

If you are a security professional, network engineer, or software developer, you are most definitely familiar with regular expressions because they are considered “a Swiss army knife” for many uses. A regular expression (sometimes referred to as “regex”) is a text string for describing a search pattern. Regular expressions go beyond regular wildcards (such as \*.mp3 to find all .mp3 files in a folder). Regular expressions can do a lot more. They are used in programming languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, Java, .NET, and several others. They are also commonly used to create intrusion detection signatures and search patterns in security tools.

## Regex Supplemental Resources

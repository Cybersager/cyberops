# Regular Expressions

If you are a security professional, network engineer, or software developer, you are most definitely familiar with regular expressions because they are considered “a Swiss army knife” for many uses. A regular expression (sometimes referred to as “regex”) is a text string for describing a search pattern. Regular expressions go beyond regular wildcards (such as \*.mp3 to find all .mp3 files in a folder). Regular expressions can do a lot more. They are used in programming languages such as Perl, Python, PHP, Java, .NET, and several others. They are also commonly used to create intrusion detection signatures and search patterns in security tools.

Chapter 3 of the SECOPS Book, "Fundamentals of Intrusion Analysis", includes a few examples of regular expressions. The following are several additional resources that will help you become familiar with regular expressions, if you are not familiar with them.
